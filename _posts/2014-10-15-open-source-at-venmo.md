title: "How to get started with open-source at a company"

A few months ago, I wrote about getting started in open-source as an individual. (You can read that [here](https://medium.com/@ayanonagon/what-ive-learned-from-open-source-d0edb165eaa1).) TL;DR it’s a tonne of fun and it cultivates a culture of “If you see something that can be improved, fork it.” Or in other words, “If you see something that can be improved, do something about it yourself.”

Once I started thinking about how individuals can start contributing to open-source, I started thinking about how organizations and companies can get started as well. Companies and organizations have a different set of constraints and goals. The constraint might be something like, “We have only x number of engineers and an insane number of things that we need to get done in our product!” For my team, it’s “We have only 3 iOS engineers and an insane number of things that we need to get done in our app!”

At Venmo, we do a fair bit of open-source work. You can check out some of our projects [here](http://github.com/venmo). Our process isn’t perfect and it might not be a one-size-fits-all solution, but we hope to share with you some things that have worked for us.

TODO: Constraints
1. We only have x number of engineers
2. We have an insane number of things that we need to get done in our product!
3. Maintaining open-source projects is time-consuming

TODO: Good stuff
1. But it's all worth it
2. It builds a culture of get things done
3. You get help from other people in the world
4. It's great for hiring

Do you do open-source work at your company or want to get started? We’d love to get your feedback and ideas and hear what’s worked for you!
